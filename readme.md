Tavern - RPG Match Maker & Game Finder
======================================

Main Goal
---------

The biggest problem in traditional games such as Pathfinder, Dungeons
and Dragons, Warhammer, etc is finding people to play with. You need at
the least four people to form a good group to play any of these games. A
lot of people today use forums to find other players, hope they just run
into people who would be interested, or use something such as Roll20's
built-in "LFG" system. This service will offer a long list of games that
are going to be happening within one's area or online soon. These games
will consist of a genre such as Fantasy, Cyberpunk, or so on. Along with
that, it will show who has already joined into the game such as other
players or the Game Master, the person who runs the game. A GM or Player
can start a game and define the player cap.

Stretch Goals
-------------

If there is time to, it will also try to guess a good group for the
user, in a similar way that OKCupid uses a long list of questions to
find a good match. This will show how well you would do with a group of
players, or with individual players.
