	<p>The biggest problem in traditional games such as Pathfinder, Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer, etc is finding people to play with. You need at the least four people to form a good group to play any of these games. A lot of people today use forums to find other players, hope they just run into people who would be interested, or use something such as Roll20's built-in &quot;LFG&quot; system. This service will offer a long list of games that are going to be happening within one's area or online soon. These games will consist of a genre such as Fantasy, Cyberpunk, or so on. Along with that, it will show who has already joined into the game such as other players or the Game Master, the person who runs the game. A GM or Player can start a game and define the player cap.</p>

	<p>If there is time to, it will also try to guess a good group for the user, in a similar way that OKCupid uses a long list of questions to find a good match. This will show how well you would do with a group of players, or with individual players.</p>
