<h3>A word from the developer</h3>
<p>This has truely be an incredibly fun project and I hope it gets a lot of use. It means a lot to me that this was finished, not just to myself, but that I can see a real need for it. Having a change to combine so many different technologies to create something new like this. Finding a group is the number one issue I hear about, and I hope that this will work to try and mitigate that issue.</p><cite>Antonio Menteguiaga</cite>
